## Background 
STRING is a database of functional interactions. STRING interactions are inferred from a variety of different experimental and computational categories, scored with a confidence score and made available as network edges where the nodes are ENSEMBL protein IDs. The dataframe (STRINGedges) used in this package contains edges of the STRING database mapped to HGNC symbols. [https://github.com/hyginn/BCB420.2019.STRING]
In this function, I use STRING score as an indicator of "connection". If edge between two symbols does not exist in our STRINGedges dataframe, I will count the score as 0.


## Input Info
1. components of each system from systems data
2. STRINGedges dataframe which contains edges of the STRING database mapped to HGNC symbols
3. HGNC symbol of interest,our function will output the most system related to this HGNC symbol


## Function Usage
```
#load data
STRINGedges <- fetchData("STRINGedges0.9")
myDB <- fetchData("SysDB")

#use the function
> RelSys(myDB,"CFTR")
  SystemName Components Interactions     Score
4      HVGCR         21            6 263.90476
1      PHALY         65            4  56.23077
2      SLIGR         60            0   0.00000
3      NLRIN         49            0   0.00000
> mostRelSys(myDB,"CFTR")
[1] "HVGCR"
```

## Function description

There are several situations I considered: 

* If there is no interactions between components in the system and the input gene, the final score should be 0.
* If System A and B have the same number of components, and components in system A have higher STRING score with input gene than system B, the output should be system A.
* Input gene is considered more related to system A than B if system A have higher percetage of interactions among all of its components.

So I choose to use [finalscore = sum of STRING score of all components with input gene/ number of components in the system]

The calculation goes as follow:

1. Sum up the STRING scores between each component gene symbol in current system and the input HGNC symbol to get a total score
2. Devide the total score by the number of components in each system to get final score

The first function "RelSys"" will output a dataframe which contains system names, number of components in each system, number of interactions in each system with the input gene, and a score calculated by above method, orderer by score.

The second function "mostRelSys" will output the name of the system with highest score.



## Runtime
For system data with n systems,each with m components:
Runtime for function mostRelSys: O(mn)
Runtime for generating all potential hierarchies:O(n!m^2)(n! possible subsystem relationship, each system have m component, each checking using mostRelSys cost O(mn), total is O(n!*m*mn))

```
> system.time({mostRelSys(myDB,"CFTR")})
  user system   流逝 
  1.57   0.33   1.89 
```
## Exploration

I want to use "mostRelSys" function to answer the question: is there any hierachy among the system data, that is, suppose A is a subsystem of B,which means (almost) all components in A are in B, can we find a way to detect this relationship. If A is a subsystem of B, then mostRelSys function should output system A for all common gene between system A and B. 

I want to use this function to generate hypothesises of the hierarchy structure among systems by detecting such pattern, note that even we find that all common components between A and B are more related to A, it does not mean that A is a subsystem of B.
